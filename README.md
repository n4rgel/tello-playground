# tello playground
 playground with djitellopy notebooksfor drones and visual computing
 
 "drone-handgestures_play.ipynb" and "drone_face_play.ipynb" are the notebooks for play with the drone,
 there are a deeplearning implementation for handgestures recognition and face detection that I use for face tracking and hand gesture controll.
 the notebooks without a "drone" are the first tryes of the models with the webcam.
